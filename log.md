# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started to configure Gulp processes for WordPress redesign of a RoR site I made last fall, to a) make it easier for people to make blog posts, and b) to get more experience with WordPress dev and design.

**Thoughts:** I struggled some with setting up the CSS Gulp processes, but with a few Google searches was able to figure it out. Google also helped with setting up browser-sync correctly. ðŸ˜„

### Day 1: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up initial PostCSS (Gulp integration + CSS organization), started to set up functions.php, and split off to make front-page.php for the homepage, saving index.php for blog page later. Added Normalize.css.

**Thoughts:** It took a bit of going back and forth to recall the code needed to integrate PostCSS successfully, but got past it pretty easily. Starting to make the CSS organization was fun. (I was going to catch up on President Obama's farewell speech first before doing this (was trying to watch + do my non-programming job at same time, no luck), but knew it wouldn't leave enough time to. So I'll watch it now, haha.)

### Day 2: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started to modify the primary (top) navbar for the site, including logo to the left and button to the right. Wrestled some with adding a hero image to the front page. I think I want to make it so it can be changed out within the WP admin, so I'll look into that and see if I can get started on it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** The navbar stuff was pretty easy, and I also thought adding the hero image would be easy as I've done it before for other sites; I was wrong lol. Got a bit peeved at the difficulties here. Hoping it comes to me after reading some more on it all soon. ðŸ‘Œ
