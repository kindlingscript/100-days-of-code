**Today's Progress**: Started to configure Gulp processes for WordPress redesign of a RoR site I made last fall, to a) make it easier for people to make blog posts, and b) to get more experience with WordPress dev and design.

**Thoughts:** I struggled some with setting up the CSS Gulp processes, but with a few Google searches was able to figure it out. Google also helped with setting up browser-sync correctly. ðŸ˜„
